------------------

**What are XML services?**

The format xml is used to exchange information throught the internet for direct application-to-application communication;

------------------

**The difference XML and HTML**

XML was designed to hold data, instead HTML focus on display data. Also, the tags in xml file are not predefined as in HTML.
------------------
**Note:** 

The XML file must have a root element that is the parent of all others elements;
example:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<note>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>
```

the `<note>` is the root element.

------------------
**Note:**

the XML prolog
`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>` it is optional.
UTF-8 is the default for XML files.

------------------
**Note:** 

XML tags are case sensitive.

------------------
**What's the difference between element and attribute?**

r: the attributes is information related to the element. The value of the attribute goes inside the tag. The elements inside an element are like
a more complex attributes for the element parent. Take a look at the example below:

info gender as attribute:
<person gender="female">
  <firstname>Anna</firstname>
  <lastname>Smith</lastname>
</person>

info gender as element:
```xml
<person>
  <gender>female</gender>
  <firstname>Anna</firstname>
  <lastname>Smith</lastname>
</person>
```

the *gender* will be the same info to *person*. In the first example gender is an attribute. In the last, gender is an element. Both examples provide the same information.

some points to consider when trying to use **attributes**

    1. cannot contain multiple values
    2. cannot contain tree structure (attributes of the attribute)
